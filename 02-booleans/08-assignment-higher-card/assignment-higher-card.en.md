# Higher Cards

Playing cards have one of thirteen different values.
We represent each by a number, as shown below:


| Card Value | Number |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Ace        | 1      |
| Two        | 2      |
| Three      | 3      |
| Four       | 4      |
| Five       | 5      |
| Six        | 6      |
| Seven      | 7      |
| Eight      | 8      |
| Nine       | 9      |
| Ten        | 10     |
| Jack       | 11     |
| Queen      | 12     |
| King       | 13     |

The number can be seen as the "value" of a card.
For example, an eight is more valuable than a two, and a king is more valuable than a jack.

The ace is a tricky one: in some games, it is worth little, but in others games, it is the most valuable card.
We happen to be playing a game where the ace is the most valuable card.

### `TASK`

Write a function `higher_card(card1, card2)` that returns `True` if `card1` is worth more than `card2`.

#### USAGE

```python
# Five is worth more than two
>>> higher_card(5, 2)
True

# Two is not worth more than five
>>> higher_card(2, 5)
False

# King is worth more than jack
>>> higher_card(13, 11)
True

# Ace is worth more than king
>>> higher_card(1, 13)
True

# We want strictly higher
>>> higher_card(8, 8)
False
```

#### `HINT`

This exercise is trickier than it might look.
Let's break it down in smaller pieces and then glue them together.

We need to find a boolean expression that expresses that `card1` is worth more than `card2`.
We know that if `card2 == 1` (i.e., an ace) the function can never return `True`.
We can therefore exclude all cases where `card2 == 1`, which gives us

```python
card2 != 1 and ???
```

To determine what `???` needs to be, we can assume `card2 != 1`.
So, given that assumption, when is `card1` the more valuable one?

- When `card1`'s numeric value is higher; _or_
- When `card1` is an ace.
