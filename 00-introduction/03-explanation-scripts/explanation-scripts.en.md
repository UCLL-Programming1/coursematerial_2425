# Scripts

While it is technically possible to develop your Python projects using the shell, it would be a rather awkward experience.
Instead, Python code is typically written in a file (typically called a *Python script*) after which you tell Python to execute all commands written in that script.

## TASK

Using VSCode, create a file named `my-script.py` and add the following code to it:


```python
1 + 2
```

## Running your Script

Now that you've written a Python script, you'll want to tell Python to run it.

## TASK
Open a shell in the same directory as `my-script.py` and enter the following commands


```bash
# If you're on Windows
$ py my-script.py

# If you're on MacOS
$ python3 my-script.py

# If you're on Linux
$ python my-script.py
```


Hmm, it does not appear to do anything.
We kind of hoped it would output `3`...

When using the Python shell, Python will always print out the result of the last evaluation.
This is not true for a script.
This also makes perfect sense: imagine playing a game while having Python print out the results of all millions of calculations performed.

So, when using scripts, you have to explicitly ask Python to print out the result.

## TASK
Change the contents of `my-script.py` to


```python
print(1 + 2)
```

Now run it again.


```bash
# Use the right command for your OS
$ py my-script.py
3
```
