# Dictionaries

Consider the following situations:

* You need to translate a text and would like having a dictionary that, given a word in English gives the corresponding word in Dutch.

  | English | Dutch |
  | ------- | ----- |
  | cat | kat |
  | dog | hond |

* You have found a recipe for a delicious chocolate cake.
  It comes with a list of ingredients and the required quantities for each.

  | Ingredient | Quantity |
  | ---------- | -------- |
  | chocolate | 250g |
  | eggs | 5 |
  | sugar | 125g |
  | flour | 75g |
  | butter | 175g |

* Given a student number, you wish to know the name of the student associated with that number.

  | Student Number | Student Name |
  | -------------- | ------------ |
  | r0123456 | Karen Eiffel |
  | r0654321 | Harold Crick |
  | r0121212 | Ana Pascal |
  | r0954321 | Jules Hilbert |


In each cases, we can represent this data as a table.
Each row associated some data in the left column with some other data in the right column:

* `cat` is associated with `kat`.
* `chocolate` is associated with `250g`.
* `r0123465` is associated with `Karen Eiffel`.

We call the data in the left columns the *keys* and the corresponding data in the right column the *values*.

Python allows us to easily model such data using *dictionaries*, or `dict`s for short.
Here's what the translation dictionary would look like:


```python
translating_dictionary = {'cat': 'kat', 'dog': 'hond'}
```



Dictionaries are not limited to strings: both keys and values can have any type.
Dictionaries can even contain other dictionaries recursively.
For example, this is a perfectly valid `dict`:


```python
{
    1: True,
    'a': [1, 2, 3],
    False: {1: 2, 3: 4}
}
```



### `INFO`
Actually, there *is* a limitation on the types of keys: the objects have to be *hashable* and comparable using `==`.
We'll delve further into this later.
For now, you can imagine there are no constraints on key types.
