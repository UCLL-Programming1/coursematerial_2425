# Group By

### `TASK`

Write a function `group_by_first_letter(strings)` that groups strings by their first letter and returns the results as a `dict`:

- The keys must be _uppercase_ letters.
- The values must be the sublist of `strings` that start with the corresponding key.
  The strings must appear in the same order as in `strings`.
- Only those letters that actually occur as first letter in `strings` should be included as keys.
  In other words, all values should be nonempty lists.
- `strings` will only contain nonempty strings that start with letters.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> group_by_first_letter(['Anne', 'Albert', 'aardvark', 'Boris', 'Chris'])
{
    'A': ['Anne', 'Albert', 'aardvark'],  # Appear in same order as in argument
    'B': ['Boris'],
    'C': ['Chris']
    # Note: no D, E, F, ...
}
```
