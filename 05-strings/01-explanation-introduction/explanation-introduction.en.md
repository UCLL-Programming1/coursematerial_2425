# Strings

Besides numbers, programs also need to be able to deal with text: passwords, messages, HTML pages, ... are all forms of text.
Programming languages' answer to this need are _strings_.

```python
message = "Hello world!"
```

Here, the string `"Hello world!"` is assigned to the variable `message`.
As you can see, strings are delimited by double quotes `"..."`.
The quotes themselves are not part of the string, they merely indicate where it starts and end.

Python also allows the usage of single quotes: `'Hello world!'` is the exact same string.

Strings have all kinds of operations defined on them.
We'll introduce them in the next series of exercises.
