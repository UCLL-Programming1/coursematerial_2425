# Last Character

### `TASK`

Write a function `last_character(string)` that returns the `string`'s last character.

If `string` is empty, there is no last character.
Return `None` in this case.

#### `HINT`

- You will need to determine the `string`'s length.
- Consider the string `"abc"` and determine the index for each character starting from the left.
  How does the index of the last character relate to the length?
