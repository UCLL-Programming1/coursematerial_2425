# Indexing

A string can be seen as a sequence of characters.
You can access each of these characters individually using indexing:

```python
>>> string = "abc"
>>> string[0]
"a"

>>> string[1]
"b"

>>> string[2]
"c"
```

### `IMPORTANT`

Note that the indexing is _zero-based_, which means that the first element has index 0 and not 1.
