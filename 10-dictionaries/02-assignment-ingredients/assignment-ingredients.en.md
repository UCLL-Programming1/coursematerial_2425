# Ingredients

These were the ingredients for the chocolate cake in table form.

| Ingredient | Quantity |
| ---------- | -------- |
| chocolate  | 250g     |
| eggs       | 5        |
| sugar      | 125g     |
| flour      | 75g      |
| butter     | 175g     |

### `TASK`

Write a function `ingredients()` that returns a `dict` containing the information above.

All keys and values should be strings.
In other words, represent the 5 in the eggs rows with `"5"`.

#### `HINT`

The function will have the form

```python
def ingredients():
    return {
        key1: value1,
        key2: value2,
        ...
    }
```

where `key1`, `key2`, &hellip; are the ingredient names and `value1`, `value2`, &hellip; the corresponding quantities.
