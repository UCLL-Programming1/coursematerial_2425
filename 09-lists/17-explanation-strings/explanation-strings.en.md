# Strings

## Splitting Strings

Converting a string to a list works on the level of single characters:

```python
>>> list("abcd")
["a", "b", "c", "d"]
```

Typically, we want something "smarter".
Say we have the string `"Blondie,Angel Eyes,Tuco"` and want to extract the three names.
More specifically, we want to construct the list `["Blondie", "Angel Eyes", "Tuco"]`.

The string method `split` does exactly that: [`string.split(separator)`](https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/stdtypes.html#str.split) will cut `string` into pieces, where each piece is delimited by `separator`.

#### `EXAMPLE`

```python
>>> "a,b,c".split(",")
["a", "b", "c"]

# Be careful with spaces
>>> "one, two, three".split(",")
["one", " two", " three"]

>>> "one, two, three".split(", ")
["one", "two", "three"]
```


## Joining Strings

The opposite operation `separator.join(strings)` can also come in handy: given a tuple/list of strings `strings`, we want to join them together into a single string.
The different strings are "glued" together using `separator`.

#### `EXAMPLE`


```python
>>> ", ".join(["a", "b", "c"])
"a, b, c"

>>> " and ".join(["Mac", "Charlie", "Dennis", "Dee"])
'Mac and Charlie and Dennis and Dee'
```
