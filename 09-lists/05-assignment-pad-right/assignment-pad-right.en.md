# Pad Right

### `TASK`

Write the function `pad_right(xs, length, padding)` that takes as parameters

- a list `xs`;
- a desired length `length`;
- a padding value `padding`.

`pad_right(xs, length, padding)` adds `padding` values to the end of the list such that `xs` ends up with `length` items.
If `xs` already contains `length` items (or more), nothing needs to be done.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> pad_right(xs, 8, 'x')
>>> xs
[1, 2, 3, 4, 'x', 'x', 'x', 'x']

>>> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4]
>>> pad_right(xs, 6, 0)
>>> xs
[1, 2, 3, 4, 0, 0]

>>> xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> pad_right(xs, 6, 0)
>>> xs
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```
