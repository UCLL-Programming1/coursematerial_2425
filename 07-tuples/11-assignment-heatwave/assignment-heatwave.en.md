# Heatwaves

A [heatwave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_wave) is a period of abnormally hot weather.
What constitutes "abnormally hot" depends on the region.
In Belgium, a heatwave is defined as follows:

- The heatwave period must be at least five consecutive days long.
- During these days, the temperature must be at least 25&deg;C.
- During at least three days the temperature must reach 30&deg;C or more.

### `TASK`

Write a function `heatwave(temperatures)` that checks whether a heatwave occurred and returns `True` if that's the case, `False` if not.

- `temperatures` is a tuple containing daily temperature measurements.
- Note that a heatwave does not need to encompass the entire period represented by `temperatures`.
  Finding a subsequence that satisfies the heatwave conditions is sufficient.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> heatwave((25, 30, 31, 30, 28))
True

# Heatwave starting on second day
>>> heatwave((24, 28, 31, 35, 36, 32, 20))
True

>>> heatwave((24, 26, 28, 31, 29, 27, 32, 25, 27, 26, 30, 23))
True

# Not long enough for a heatwave
>>> heatwave((40, 40, 40, 40))
False

# Hot period is not contiguous
>>> heatwave((40, 20, 40, 40, 40, 40))
False
```

#### `HINT`

- Process the `temperatures` from left to right.
- Introduce two local variables.
  - One keeps the count of temperatures `>= 25`.
  - The other keeps the count of temperatures `>= 30`.
- Increment these variables as you go through the list.
- When you encounter a temperature lower than 25, reset both variables to 0.
- If at any point the 25-count is at least 5 and the 30-count is at least 3, you've got a heatwave.
