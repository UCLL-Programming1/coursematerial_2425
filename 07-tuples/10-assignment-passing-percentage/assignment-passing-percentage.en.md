# Passing Percentage

You receive the grades of all students for a certain course.
Students who scored at least 10 pass.
We want to compute the passing percentage.

### `TASK`

Write a function `passing_percentage(grades)` that returns the passing percentage.

#### USAGE

```python
# All students passed
>>> passing_percentage((20, 20))
100

# One passed, one failed
>>> passing_percentage((10, 9))
50

>>> passing_percentage((5, 10, 15, 20))
75
```
