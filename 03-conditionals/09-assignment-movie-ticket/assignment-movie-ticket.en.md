# Movie Ticket

Let's go to the movies!
But let's first see how much the tickets cost&hellip;

The ticket cost depends on multiple factors.
First, the duration determines the base cost.

| Duration        | Base Price |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| up to 90        | &euro;10   |
| 90 - 120        | &euro;11   |
| 120 - 150       | &euro;12   |
| longer than 150 | &euro;15   |

Next, if it's the IMAX version, add 20% and round up.
Lastly, students get a &euro;3 discount.

### `TASK`

Write a function `movie_ticket(duration, imax, student, ticket_count)` that computes the total cost of movie tickets.

- `duration` is an `int`.
- `imax` and `student` are boolean values.
- `ticket_count` is an `int`.

#### USAGE

```python
>>> movie_ticket(70, False, False, 1)
10

>>> movie_ticket(70, False, True, 1)
7

>>> movie_ticket(70, False, True, 3)
21

>>> movie_ticket(180, True, False, 2)
36
```
