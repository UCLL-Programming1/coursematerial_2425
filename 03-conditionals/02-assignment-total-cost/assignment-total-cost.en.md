# Total Cost

Your favorite webshop has the following rules:

- If your order costs less than &euro;100, you need to pay a delivery fee of &euro;10.
- If your order costs at least &euro;200, you get 5% discount.

### `TASK`

Write a function `total_cost(amount)` that computes the total cost after taking into account the delivery fee and the discount.

Use two `if` statements:

- The first should deal with the delivery fee and increase `amount` if necessary.
- The second should deal with the discount and decrease `amount` if necessary.

#### USAGE

```python
# Order costs less than 50, so add delivery fee
>>> total_cost(50)
60

# Order costs more than 50 but less than 200
# No delivery fee but no discount either
>>> total_cost(150)
150

# Order costs more than 200
# No delivery fee and discount
>>> total_cost(500)
475
```
