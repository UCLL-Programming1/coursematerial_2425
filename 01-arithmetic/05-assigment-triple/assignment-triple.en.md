# Assignment

Write a function `triple(x)` that, given a number `x`, returns the triple of this value.
The code should be *added* to `student.py`.

Note that multiplication is represented by the symbol `*` in Python (as it is in most other programming languages.)


To help you understand better what's expected from you, exercises will often show some usage examples.


```python
# 0 times 3 equals 0
>>> triple(0)
0

# 1 times 3 equals 3
>>> triple(1)
3

# 2 times 3 equals 6
>>> triple(2)
6

>>> triple(1111)
3333
```
