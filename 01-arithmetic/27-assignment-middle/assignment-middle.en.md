# Assignment

### `TASK`
Write a function `middle(a, b, c)` that returns the "middle" element, i.e., the element that is in between the lowest and highest number.


#### INFO

This is a trickier exercise, more of a riddle. It's okay not to be able to solve this one, but resist the urge to peek at the solutions. For the more advanced students: you're only supposed to use what you've learned so far. Using conditionals makes this exercise much easier, but that's cheating.


#### USAGE

```python
>>> middle(2, 10, 4)
4

>>> middle(6, 7, 5)
6

# Equal values are also possible
>>> middle(4, 4, 2)
4
```
