# Candy

We have `candy_count` pieces of candy and want to distribute them among `child_count` children.
However, to avoid tears and cries (you know how kids are), we aim to give each child the same amount of candy.
This means we might have leftover candy, which we'll happily keep for ourselves.

Write a function `candy_per_child(candy_count, child_count)` that computes the number of candies we can maximally give each child so that each child has the same amount of candy.
