# Cake 3

Do we feel silly.
For a cake, we actually also need 200g butter and 250g sugar...
We summarize the necessary ingredients per cake:


| Ingredient | Amount per cake |
| :--------: | :-------------: |
| Eggs       | 5               |
| Flour      | 250g            |
| Butter     | 200g            |
| Sugar      | 250g            |


Who knew that making a cake was so complicated?

Write a function `cake3(eggs, flour, butter, sugar)` that returns the amount of cakes one can make given

* `eggs` number of eggs
* `flour` grams of flour
* `butter` grams of butter
* `sugar` grams of sugar

Rely on local variables to keep the code manageable.
