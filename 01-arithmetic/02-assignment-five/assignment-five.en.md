# Five

It's time for you to write your very own function!

Most exercises will have you write one or more functions.
You'll have to write these in a file `student.py` placed in the chapter's directory.


* In this file, write a function `five()` that returns `5`.
* Check your work by running the tests.
  * Run `pytest test.py` in your terminal in the assignemnts directory.


#### `HINT`

As a reminder, this is how a function that returns `0` looks like:


```python
def zero():
    return 0
```
