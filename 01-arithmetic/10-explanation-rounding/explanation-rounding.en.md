# Rounding

You can turn a floating point number into an integer by rounding it.
There are three ways to perform rounding:


| Math | Python | Description |
| ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| $\lfloor x \rfloor$ | `floor(x)` | Rounding down |
| $\lceil x \rceil$ | `ceil(x)` | Rounding up |
| | `round(x)` | Rounding to nearest integer |

### `IMPORTANT`

`floor` and `ceil` are not available by default: you first need to *import* them using the following code:

```python
# Imports are generally placed at the top of the file
from math import floor, ceil
```


[`math`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html) is a *module* that contains all kinds of math-related functions.
There are many more modules: Python itself comes with over [200 modules](https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html).
Added to this, you can download many more from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (more than 350k are available at the time of this writing).

### `EXAMPLE`

Let's see the three functions in action:


```python
>>> from math import floor, ceil
>>> floor(4.9)
4

>>> ceil(2.4)
3

>>> round(8.49)
8

>>> round(8.51)
9
```
