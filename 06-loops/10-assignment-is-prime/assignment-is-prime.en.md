# Is Prime?

A positive integer is a _prime number_ if its only divisors are 1 and itself.
For example, 12 is not prime as it can be divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12.
17, however, is prime because it can only be divided by 1 and 17.

Note that 1 is not considered a prime number.

#### `TASK`

Write a function `is_prime(n)` that returns `True` if `n` is prime, `False` otherwise.

`n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
